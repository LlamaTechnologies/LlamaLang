// code conventions

always use struct over class unless it has to many private members

every llvm value in struct|class should have the prefix llvm_

enums should be enum class

everything that wont be modified should be declared 'const'

minimize the use of exceptions. always use the version without exceptions in std lib

constexpr instead of #define

every build should have no warnings!

annotate with noexcept always and LL_NODISCARD as needed

should use this-> always so it is clear where the symbol comes from
